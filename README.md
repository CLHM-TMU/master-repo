# Core Laboratory of Human Microbiome @ Taipei Medical University

Our lab provides end-to-end services from storing biological samples to publication-ready reports. This includes step like DNA extraction, artefact creation, taxa classification, diversity + phylogenetic analysis, and functional metabolomics prediction. Currently we handle:
* Next Generation Sequencing (16S V3-V4 rRNA)
* Third Generation Sequencing (16S Full Length)
* Shotgun Metagenomics
* Anaerobic Bacterium Cultivation

## Naming Convention Guide
It is suggested to keep your naming convention simple, i.e. use hyphens for QIIME2 artefacts(.qza, .qzv) and underscores for everything else (.tsv, .csv) so you know which files are meant to be only processed via QIIME2.

## Environment Guide
This is the Linux repository. Per-rule software (QIIME2, PICRUSt2, LEfSe, ALDEx2, the report compiler) runs inside Apptainer containers rather than ad hoc conda environments, so a run is reproducible regardless of what happens to be installed on the host.

**Running the pipeline**: activate an environment with Snakemake and Apptainer installed (`environment.yml` defines this — e.g. `conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate smk9`), then invoke Snakemake with `--sdm apptainer`:
```
snakemake --sdm apptainer --configfile config/<your_config>.yaml <target>
```
`--sdm` (`--software-deployment-method`) tells Snakemake to run each rule's `container:` directive through Apptainer instead of provisioning a conda env per rule.

Prefer running through `scripts/run_snakemake.sh` instead of calling `snakemake` directly — it's a drop-in wrapper (same arguments) that runs the pipeline inside a transient systemd cgroup with swap disabled, so a rule that runs away on memory gets killed fast instead of thrashing the whole host into swap:
```
scripts/run_snakemake.sh --sdm apptainer --configfile config/<your_config>.yaml <target>
```
Override the memory ceiling with `SNAKEMAKE_MEM_MAX` (cgroup cap, default `26G`) and `SNAKEMAKE_MEM_BUDGET` (the `mem_mb` resource budget passed to Snakemake, default `24000`).

**Monitoring a long-running Silva138 SEPP job**: `qiime fragment-insertion sepp` (used to build Silva138's per-study phylogenetic tree, see `pipeline_overview.md` Stage 3c) hides its own progress log. The rule streams a compact progress summary automatically, but if you want to attach to an already-running job from another terminal, use `scripts/watch_sepp.sh` (auto-attaches if exactly one SEPP job is running, or pass a PID if several are).

**Building/rebuilding containers**: each `containers/<name>.sif` is built from the matching `containers/<name>.def`, which in turn installs the matching `envs/<name>.yaml` conda spec. `envs/*.yaml` stays the source of truth for package lists — edit those, not a built `.sif` directly. Run `containers/build.sh` to build any `.def` missing a `.sif`, or `containers/build.sh --force <name>` to rebuild one after editing its `envs/*.yaml`. Snakemake does not rebuild containers on its own, and builds must run one at a time (`build.sh` already does this) — concurrent `apptainer build --fakeroot` runs corrupt each other via fakeroot namespace contention.

**Filesystem access inside containers**: Snakemake invokes Apptainer without `--contain`/`--containall`, so containers share the host filesystem by default — `main/` and `reference/` are already visible inside every container with no `--bind` configuration needed. Do not add `--contain`/`--containall` via `--apptainer-args` unless you also add explicit `--bind` flags for `main/` and `reference/`, or those paths will silently disappear inside the container.
